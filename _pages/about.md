*About this digital garden*

This is my digital garden, kept by me, for me. I am Henrik Kramselund he/him a freelance network and security internet samurai living in Denmark.

If you feel like taking a walk through it, be my guest. There is not much to see yet.


## Matureness for content

Inspired by the ideas from Maggie Appleton I have chosen to re-use this:

* ðŸŒ± Seedlings for very rough and early ideas
* ðŸŒ¿ Budding for work I've cleaned up and clarified
* ðŸŒ³ Evergreen for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).

## How was this made
This digital garden template is free, open-source, and [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

There are some instructions below which I keep for my own use, pls ignore.

* The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
