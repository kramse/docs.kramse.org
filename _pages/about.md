*About this digital garden*

This is my digital garden, kept by me, for me. I am Henrik Kramselund he/him a freelance network and security internet samurai living in Denmark.

If you feel like taking a walk through it, be my guest. There is not much to see yet.

Maybe you can find something interesting in Github og Codeberg?

I am in the process of testing [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) and moving stuff away from Github. The main reason is that they are pushing hard for AI products, based on source and code from peoples repositories.

## Categories for content

Inspired by the categories from Maggie Appleton I have chosen to re-use this:

* ðŸŒ± Seedlings for very rough and early ideas
* ðŸŒ¿ Budding for work I've cleaned up and clarified
* ðŸŒ³ Evergreen for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).
