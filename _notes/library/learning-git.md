## Learning Git ðŸŒ¿

Why learning Git is important.

It is important because you will write, create and produce files with all sorts of important data. This may be a thesis, report or article, it may include results, calculations, programs, web pages, diagrams and pictures -- really everything is files.

So by using Git you will have a repository of your files which is versioned and can be updated by multiple people at different times. This is critical in software development, which Git was designed for, but in many other workflows this will help you in keeping things in control.

The main web site for Git is [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and should be the main site to bookmark for learning Git.

There are also a number of great books about Git, and if you are new to this I recommend this one:

*Learning Git: A Hands-On and Visual Approach to Understanding the Basics of Git* by Anna Skoulikari (published by O'Reilly).

### Use example tools

You will also be able to find resources in places like [Github](https://github.com/) and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), examples you can learn from, use directly or be inspired from. If these are open source they may provide a foundation to create a solution that match your use case. For instance I recommend [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) which is an email security standard, but produces [XML files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), which can be difficult to parse.

Searching on Github/Codeberg you *will find* complete software packages that may solve your problem with parsing DMARC XML files. An example I have used is parsedmarc [https://domainaware.github.io/parsedmarc/](https://domainaware.github.io/parsedmarc/)

So often you can either solve your problem, or re-use existing code and libraries to do the heavy lifting - and you will be more efficient.

### Awesome lists in Git repositories

Another concept is the *awesome lists* you can find curated lists of subjects within some area, and updating this is easy when you git clone the content to your own system. Examples:

* Awesome Incident Response [https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-incident-response](https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-incident-response)
* Aesome Kubernetes Resources [https://github.com/tomhuang12/awesome-k8s-resources](https://github.com/tomhuang12/awesome-k8s-resources)

Note: these are examples and they include many references, so I cannot vouch for the content, but they are great starting point for researching new stuff
