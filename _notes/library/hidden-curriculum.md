### Welcome to the Hidden Curriculum

So you want to learn something, great. Unfortunately sometimes this is harder than it should be, and sometimes we can make it much easier.

I am talking about the situations where learning a subject requires you to know some existing dependencies or skills, before you can absorb the new thing - which is the goal!

So this page is about foundational things and skills I think most technical people within networking and information security (infosec) will need. Target audience is students beginning in computer science, infosec and networking (TCP/IP), which may be you if you are switching jobs and want to learn more technical stuff.

I come from many years of giving talks, workshops and even some formal education at an accredited institution KEA with the european [ECTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System). While teaching I will not have a lot of time to go into these subjects, and while some students pick them up while learning some subject - this puts a strain on your brain! Hence this page.

To be efficient in learning the technical subjects like those found in my [security courses repository](https://codeberg.org/kramse/security-courses) I recommend learning
things like:
* [[Learning Git ðŸŒ¿]]
* [[Select a text editor ðŸŒ±]]
* [[Writing Documentation ðŸŒ±]]
* [[Gathering Notes ðŸŒ±]]
* [[Learn Linux and Unix ðŸŒ±]]


These will be introduced in seperate notes, and you can find similar lists of topics in other places - which inspired this list:
* [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT
