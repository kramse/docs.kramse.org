**Make a note of that!**

Most of us have limited capacity and I have found that I need to write things down, and I use multiple methods.

Some notes are scribbled on left over paper on the desk, some are in a ToDo system, others are handwritten in a SuperNote device (warning expensive). A huge amount of notes and references are kept in [Zim - A Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/)



### SuperNote

I got my SuperNote A5X in 2022, and still using it in 2025 - and looks almost brand new. The device is quite nice to write on and read books.

Pros:
* Great surface
* Quick enough for writing and reading, browsing pages in PDF works good
* Updated software which has improved with some nice features years after purchase, like the [Smart Straight Line](https://supernote.com/blogs/supernote-blog/introducing-the-smart-straight-line-feature-and-smoother-handwriting-strokes)
* Can sync files with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive and SuperNote Cloud
* Can do some mail integration to Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, Outlook/Hotmail/Live or IMAP - haven't tried it

Cons:
* Quite expensive!
* Calendar integratioon requires Microsoft Outlook or Google calendar

### Zim - A Desktop Wiki  

I am a long time user of the project [Zim - A Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/)

There are others that prefer [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or Microsoft OneNote but for me Zim has worked great.

The main reasons may be:

* Quick and easy to edit the notes, hotkeys to mark headers, console output, copy some text from somewhere into the Zim window
* Multiple pages open in tabbed mode for multitasking

and the main reason may be, that it integrates with Git versioning! So I can use Zim on multiple systems and sync notes when I want to, and yes sometimes I forget to "Create Version" and sync, but not a huge problem.

### What ToDo

I use a commercial solution for To Do and *project management* because I have found it to be easy to use. They have apps for my phone and tablet, so I can add todo items whenever I need to. It also has a LOT of nice features.

The screenshot is quite empty, but *My Work* show the items across the boards dependent on the date, so a nice overview.

Unfortunately it is a bit pricey, as you have to pay for at least 3 users and their plans start at $9 per seat/month - so $27/month. Read more on the web site is [https://monday.com/](https://monday.com/)

We are looking into [TaskJuggler](https://github.com/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler) but it may be more for creating project plans, like Microsoft Project - but with open source.
