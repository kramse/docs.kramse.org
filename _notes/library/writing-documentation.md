## Writing Documentation ðŸŒ±

So you want to learn something, then make notes! There are many benefits from writing things down and usually people will remember better what they learn. Other times you will need to persuade someone to do something, or you have created something - a program or system that others will need to interact with.

So documentation is needed, but how?!

First I will present a few options for tools to do the writing in, which are the ones I use:

* Markdown is an easy to learn writing method which is great for short notes, but can be used for complete books
* LaTeX is originally from *academic cirles* and seldom used in commercial enterprises. Takes some effort to learn, but shines when you create big documents or interlinked document. It can feel like you are programming the output, which is not far from reality

Afterwards you will need to find ways to structure your writing, and that will probably be dependent on the materials you aim to produce. Examples include

* Writing documentation for software projects may want to use a resource such as *Docs for Developers*  by Jared Bhatti, Sarah Corleissen, Jen Lambourne, David NuÃ±ez, Heidi Waterhouse [https://docsfordevelopers.com/](https://docsfordevelopers.com/)

### Writing MarkDown

> Markdown[9] is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as an easy-to-read markup language.[9] Markdown is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere in online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

You can write MarkDown in many ways, and you will need something like a text editor
