title: Upgrading Kubernetes ðŸŒ±
permalink: /kubernetes-upgrade

So, I just upgraded Kubernetes (K8s) and for myself, lets document it.

Basically I followed the instructions from:
* [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/) because I am using Kubeadm

I upgraded from 1.31 over 1.32 to 1.33, we are in mid May 2025, and 1.33 came out recently.

The process was for each upgrade
1. Update repositories
2. Upgrade `kubeadm` from say 1.32 which you are running to 1.33 which is the version you want
3. Run `kubeadm upgrade plan` to check a few tings
4. perform upgrade on controler to the version you want, like `kubeadm upgrade apply v1.33.1`
5. Upgrade software, CRI-O container, kubectl and kubelet etc. just regular apt update/upgrade
6. Do a reboot, controlled, chaotic, whatever :-D

Expected output at the end:
```
hlk@cheese01:~$ k get node
NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
cheese01   Ready    control-plane   218d   v1.33.1
cheese02   Ready    <none>          218d   v1.33.1
```


Yes, I run this small setup with only two nodes, and no dedicated control nodes - all nodes can run pods.

## CRI-O upgrades

Installing the packages is quite easy, by specifying the versions you want:
```
KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.33
CRIO_VERSION=v1.33
```

The following the instructions from the packaging README.md:<br>
[https://github.com/cri-o/packaging/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/cri-o/packaging/blob/main/README.md)

Add the Kubernetes repository
```

  curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/deb/Release.key |
      gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

  echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/$KUBERNETES_VERSION/deb/ /" |
      tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```
Add the CRI-O repository
```
  curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/cri-o:/stable:/$CRIO_VERSION/deb/Release.key |
      gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/cri-o-apt-keyring.gpg

  echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cri-o-apt-keyring.gpg] https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/cri-o:/stable:/$CRIO_VERSION/deb/ /" |
      tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cri-o.list
```

## Logs

A few logs

Check and *plan* the upgrade, this is with kubeadm version 1.33 installed and 1.32 running:
```
# kubeadm upgrade plan

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   NODE       CURRENT   TARGET
kubelet     cheese01   v1.32.5   v1.33.1
kubelet     cheese02   v1.32.5   v1.33.1

Upgrade to the latest stable version:

COMPONENT                 NODE       CURRENT    TARGET
kube-apiserver            cheese01   v1.32.5    v1.33.1
kube-controller-manager   cheese01   v1.32.5    v1.33.1
kube-scheduler            cheese01   v1.32.5    v1.33.1
kube-proxy                           1.32.5     v1.33.1
CoreDNS                              v1.11.3    v1.12.0
etcd                      cheese01   3.5.16-0   3.5.21-0

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

	kubeadm upgrade apply v1.33.1

_____________________________________________________________________


The table below shows the current state of component configs as understood by this version of kubeadm.
Configs that have a "yes" mark in the "MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED" column require manual config upgrade or
resetting to kubeadm defaults before a successful upgrade can be performed. The version to manually
upgrade to is denoted in the "PREFERRED VERSION" column.

API GROUP                 CURRENT VERSION   PREFERRED VERSION   MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED
kubeproxy.config.k8s.io   -                 v1alpha1            no
kubelet.config.k8s.io     v1beta1           v1beta1             no
